### 🎯 Project Goal

The goal was to learn how to work with Figma and how to create a design system on it. Also, how to get all that information set up with TailwindCSS in a React project, advanced techniques such as Component Composition, documenting and testing the UI with Storybook integrated with Jest, a little bit of Radix and more.
